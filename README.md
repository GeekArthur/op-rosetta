> **Warning**
> WIP; Not bedrock-compatible yet.

Provides Rosetta API compatibility for Optimism Bedrock, a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum L2 blockchain.

## Overview

`op-rosetta` is an executable [client](./app/client.go) extending the [rosetta-geth-sdk](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-geth-sdk).

To learn more about the Rosetta API, you can find more online at [rosetta-api.org](https://www.rosetta-api.org/).

### Running

Run the `op-rosetta` client for goerli like so: `make run-optimism-goerli`.

A mainnet client can be run with `make run-optimism-mainnet`.

> **Note**
> Mainnet will only be supported once Optimism mainnet is upgraded to its Bedrock Release.


### Testing with `rosetta-cli`

_NOTE: `op-rosetta` must be running on the specified host and port provided in the configuration file. For local testing, this can be done as described in the [Running](#running) section, which will run an instance on localhost, port 8080._

See [configs/README.md](./configs/README.md) for more information.
